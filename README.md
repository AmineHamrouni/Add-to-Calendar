# Add to calendar

A simple add to calendar module in pure Vanilla JavaScript.

- No DOM manipulation.
- Handeling: Google Calendar / Yahoo Calendar / iCal / Outlook


### Note:
I found an existing js file so I completed the work.
If you are the creator of the first version of this code, I really appreciate if you communicate with me.
Thank you.
